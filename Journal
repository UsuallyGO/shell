  This is the journal of my project, it will be updated every day 
  until my project is finished.

   Today I configure the git environment of project's and update 
   it to GuiHub. At the same time, I also learn some konwledge 
   about shell. This project will be more interesting and difficult.
   But, I will do my best to finish it. See you tomorrow!

   Tonight, I learn more about shell grammer and some functions it 
   has, such as background control and so on. I think it is better
   to finish a simple shell. And add more functions day after day. 	
   So, I will code at tomorrow.
