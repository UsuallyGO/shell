   Today I configure the git environment of project's and update 
   it to GuiHub. At the same time, I also learn some konwledge 
   about shell. This project will be more interesting and difficult.
   But, I will do my best to finish it. See you tomorrow!

   Tonight, I learn more about shell grammer and some functions it 
   has, such as background control and so on. I think it is better
   to finish a simple shell. And add more functions day after day. 	
   So, I will code at next time.

   Since the parsing is more difficult than lexical analysis, so, I 
   plan to implement lexical analysis first, after this, I will  
   finish the parsing. By the way, I finish the DFA of shell command
   tonight. I believe that everything will be interesting if I stick to.
